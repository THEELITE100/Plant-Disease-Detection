#Plant Disease Detection








This project is about identifying that a plant is healthy or not using AI.

It's very easy to use, the user has to upload a image of the plant leaf and the AI will predict that it's healthy or not.


If you want to run this in your system then please download all the files in the repo and then you have to create a virtual environment to run this.
If you want more detailes there is a ppt and a project report attached with it.
